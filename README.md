## Phil Kimmey's Personal Blog & Website

I've had an old wordpress blog laying around at
philipk.com for quite some time now, but I think
it's time to have something public facing that
isn't ancient and mostly broken.

It seems likely this project won't go anywhere,
but it basically has 2 goals:

1. Create a blog that actually has a chance of getting updated
2. Learn a few new (especially client-side) technologies

With that in mind, anything actually executable will be 
written in JS and use Node.js, and the client-side will
use Backbone.js & Less.
